A poorly made shooter I made in  8th grade that looks like it was made for an Atari. It was made to be like a 2d quake, with the speed of the characters and how quickly you can die. I honestly enjoyed playing this with my friends and I honestly might update it.

Red player: Arrow keys and M to shoot.
Blue player: WASD and q to shoot.

Honestly how the the game works is pretty stupid. You run around trying to kill your opponent with your laser. If you use it, you have to wait one second for your gun to cool down before you can shoot it again.
